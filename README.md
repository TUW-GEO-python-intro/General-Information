# Aim of the course

Python is widely used in scientific applications. In this course the students
will learn the basics of Python and its most important third party packages. The
students will also learn to work with data formats commonly used for geospatial
data.

# Organization

Exact Course Dates and room assignments can be found on the
[TISS site](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?windowId=96a&courseNr=120050&semester=2015W)
of this course.

## Structure of this Github Group ##

Slides can be found in the [slide-deck repository](https://github.com/TUW-GEO-python-intro/slide-deck).
There will be separate repositories for the Exercises.

# Course Overview

This coures is (at the moment) too short to handle the topics listed below in
much detail. We will however try to give you a good overview of the available
tools so that you can explore further on your own.

Computers are provided in the EDV Lab but you are encouraged to bring your own
laptop so that you have a portable development environment.

## Git

You might already wonder what the introduction to this course is doing on
Github. To clarify this we will also offer a short introduction to Version
Control / Git. This is necessary knowledge for anyone writing programs. Basic
Git knowledge tought in the Git introduction will also be necessary to complete
at least one of the projects.

## List of topics covered

- Python overview
- Setup of a Python development environment
- Packages explained
- Python basics (Variables, Control Structures, Functions, ...)
- Important numerical packages (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- IPython and the IPython/Jupyter Notebook
- File I/O (Text files, NetCDF, HDF5, GeoTIFF, Shapefiles)
- Data Visualization on Maps
- Error Handling
- Iterators, Generators, Object oriented programming
- Profiling and optimization
- Documentation (Sphinx)
- Testing

## Homework/Projects 

- Students will be required to complete 2-3 projects during the semester. At
  least one of the projects will have to be handed in on Github.

## Installation of Python

We will try out several Python packages in this course. Some of them are not
straighforward to install from source, especially on Windows PC's. To be able to
use all the packages needed for this course easily we will use the
[Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#all). This
distribution includes all the
[packages we need an many more](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs).

## Editing Python code

For editing Python code you will need at least a text editor. You can also use
an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) if a text editor is too minimal for
you. If you do not have a favorite text editor/Development Environment then I
would recommend trying a few to see which one you like best.

The following is a list (in alphabetical order) of text editors/IDE's you might
want to try:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/): Very customizable text editor by Github. Based on
  web technologies.
- [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): Customizable to the core but has
  a high learning curve
- [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Very popular Python IDE by JetBrains
- [PyDev](http://www.pydev.org/): Eclipse Plugin for Python Development
- [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) which is based on Emacs but
  uses the modal editing from Vim. Still in development, try it out if you are
  really interested.
- [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder): "Scientific" Python
  Development Environment. Similar to Matlab in some regards.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/): Very popular text editor for
  multiple languages
- [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com/):
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/): Has it's own modal editing paradigm - also
  available on other editors

# Statements on Plagiarism

## TU Wien

The relevant documents are
[the code of conduct of TU Wien](http://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/services/recht/studium_und_forschung/information_betreffend_studierende/code_of_conduct_regeln_zur_sicherung_guter_wissenschaftlicher_praxis_beschluss_des_rektorates_vom_23_oktober_2007_deutsche_fassung_englische_fassung/)
and the
[Directive concerning the handling of plagiarism in academic papers](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/fileadmin/t/ukanzlei/Umgang_mit_Plagiaten_Engl.pdf)
and it is encouraged to follow them both.

## Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software
development and science. As a programmer or scientist you will seldomly write
things completely from scratch. This class is structured such that solutions
posted on Github are public. You are encouraged to learn from the work of your
peers. People who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, without challenging
themselves, are simply wasting their time taking this class.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you
reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the
original source with an inline comment and explain what it does in your own
words.
