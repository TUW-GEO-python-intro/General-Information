# Aim of the course

Python is widely used in scientific applications. In this course the students
will learn the basics of Python and its most important third party packages. The
students will also learn to work with data formats commonly used for geospatial
data.

# Course Overview

This coures is (at the moment) too short to handle the topics listed below in
much detail. We will however try to give you a good overview of the available
tools so that you can explore further on your own.

## Git

You might already wonder what the introduction to this course is doing on
Github. To clarify this we will also offer a short introduction to Version
Control / Git. This is necessary knowledge for anyone writing programs. Basic
Git knowledge tought in the Git introduction will also be necessary to complete
at least one of the projects.

## List of topics covered

- Python overview
- Setup of a Python development environment
- Packages explained
- Python basics (Variables, Control Structures, Functions, ...)
- Important numerical packages (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- IPython and the IPython/Jupyter Notebook
- File I/O (Text files, NetCDF, HDF5, GeoTIFF, Shapefiles)
- Data Visualization on Maps
- Error Handling
- Iterators, Generators, Object oriented programming
- Profiling and optimization
- Documentation (Sphinx)
- Testing

# Homework/Projects

- Students will be required to complete 2-3 projects during the semester. At
  least one of the projects will have to be handed in on Github.

## Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software
development and science. As a programmer or scientist you will seldomly write
things completely from scratch. This class is structured such that all solutions
are public. You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. I won't
hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without
challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time taking this class and
will probably not go very far in life.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you
reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the
original source with an inline comment.
